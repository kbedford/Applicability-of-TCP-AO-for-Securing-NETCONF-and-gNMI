    <abstract>
      <t>This document analyzes the applicability of the TCP Authentication
      Option (TCP-AO) to secure TCP-based network management protocols,
      specifically NETCONF and gNMI. It describes deployment profiles in
      which TCP-AO provides per-connection integrity and peer
      authentication with low operational overhead, either as an
      alternative to or in combination with TLS/SSH. This document gives
      guidance on key management (e.g., static keys and operational "key
      chains") and documents expected behaviors and benefits. No new
      protocol bits are defined and there are no IANA actions.</t>

      <name>Introduction and Motivation</name>
      <t>The TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925] provides connection-
      oriented integrity and peer authentication for TCP segments with
      cryptographic agility [RFC5926]. TCP-AO has seen deployment
      primarily with routing/control protocols; however, its applicability
      to network management and telemetry protocols is under-documented.</t>

      <t>This document specifies practical applicability guidance for using
      TCP-AO with two widely used TCP-based management protocols: NETCONF
      [RFC6241] (commonly over SSH [RFC6242] or TLS [RFC7589]) and gNMI
      (as specified by the OpenConfig community). TCP-AO can be used: (a)
      as a lightweight hop-by-hop integrity mechanism when TLS/SSH are
      operationally impractical; or (b) in defense-in-depth alongside
      TLS/SSH to harden the TCP substrate against spoofed resets and
      option tampering.</t>

      <name>TCP-AO Recap</name>
      <t>TCP-AO (TCP option kind 29) protects selected TCP header fields,
      options, and payload using per-connection traffic keys derived from a
      Master Key Tuple (MKT). It supports algorithm agility and hitless
      rekey via KeyIDs, as specified in [RFC5925] and [RFC5926]. TCP-AO
      provides integrity and peer authentication only; it does not provide
      confidentiality. When confidentiality is required, it SHOULD be used
      in combination with an encryption mechanism such as TLS.</t>
